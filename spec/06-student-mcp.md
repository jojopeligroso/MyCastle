### Role Requirements

## 6.6 Implementation Notes

### Authorization Considerations
- Students can only access their own data
- Cannot view other students' information
- Cannot access teacher or admin functions
- Limited to read-only access for course content

### Data Privacy
- Student data is highly sensitive
- Extra care needed for GDPR compliance
- Parents may have viewing rights (future consideration)

### Personalization and Adaptivity
- AI should track student's:
  - Past questions and mistakes
  - Concepts mastered vs struggling with
  - Preferred learning style (visual, examples, step-by-step)
  - Performance trends over time
- Adjust difficulty and explanation depth dynamically

### Cross-Role Interactions (Host-Mediated)
- Student may need data from Teacher MCP (e.g., "What's my grade?")
- Host mediates: Student MCP asks Host → Host queries Teacher MCP → Returns result
- Always respects authorization (student can only see their own grades)

### Future Enhancements
- Gamification (badges, points for progress)
- Peer study groups (connect students for collaboration)
- Multi-language support for ESL platform
- Voice interface for pronunciation practice
- Parent portal for progress monitoring
